# Basic c98 syntax primal dual solver for LPs

The idea is to have an LP solver that can run on a single GPU thread via OpenCL, to be able to solve many LPs in parallel.
A caveat of this is that much of the memory used is taken to be preallocated (as this is done CPU side).
May not be practical due to program complexity/ammount of branching. Gauss-Jordan appears to work according to simple test, but failing inside solver.
